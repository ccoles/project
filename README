This is a simple shell tool, just drop it in a folder and type ./project.sh from the command line,
the tool will create all required files and folders for your project. It is heavily based on the wonderful
HTML5 Boiler Plate project with a few modifications (sorry I removed normalize.css and replace it with reset.css) I also
add in media query style sheets for mobile, table portrait, table landscape and desktop.
